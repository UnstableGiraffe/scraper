    Webscraping is unethical only in the way that any automated computer script is 
unethical. Sure, theres plenty of unethical things you can *do* with a web scraper, 
but that is determined by how its used. Talking about the ethics of web scrapers as 
a whole is useless, its like talking about the ethics of knives, sure lots of people 
have gotten stabbed, but most use cases for them are helpful and harmless.

     Another aspect is the archival benefit to them, as any time someone writes a web 
scraper and doesnt delete the output *some* data about that site will stick around. For 
something like what were writing here, if somehow all of the sites we scraped are lost, 
whatever output we ended up with can still be used to reconstruct some idea of what was on 
them. Additionally, it is literally impossible to allow people to access a website without 
giving them the ability to extract the data that is on it automatically, so any conversation 
as to the ethics of that extraction is useless, anyone who wants to scrape data for 
unethicall purposes will still do so.
